# Junk or not? - "Taste Aberrations" from the time around 1900

150 objects and 848 pictures from the unique "collection of aberrations in taste" of the former Landesgewerbemuseum in Stuttgart comprise our data set.

A pincushion in the shape of a bound soldier is totally ugly. An inkpot hiding in the belly of a completely over-decorated metal dragon is also not at all acceptable! At least that was the opinion of Gustav E. Pazaurek, the director of Stuttgart’s former Landesgewerbemuseum. He declared war on bad taste and, from 1909 onwards, put together a "collection of aberrations in taste" at Stuttgart’s Landesgewerbemuseum. Here he exhibited everything that, in his opinion, was totally unacceptable in terms of design and should not be considered a model for any designer or producer of everyday commodities. He defined "crimes in the arts and crafts" under a variety of criteria such as "material assaults", "construction shams" or "decorative brutalities".

After the Second World War, the collections of the Landesgewerbemuseum were not presented to the public again in an institution of their own, but were distributed to state museums in Baden-Württemberg from the 1960s onwards. The Landesmuseum Württemberg took over around 40,000 objects from the defunct Landesgewerbemuseum, including the highly regarded "collection of aberrations in taste". To this day, the sometimes very curious objects have lost none of their charm. We agree with Pazaurek about some of them and still consider them tasteless today. Others, on the other hand, we would perhaps assess differently today and, viewed from a historical distance, would certainly put them in our living rooms.

Most of the objects in the collection were digitalised by the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek within the framework of the NEUSTART KULTUR programme funded by the Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien (BKM). The corresponding collection objects are marked with a note.  

All available collection objects are published in the online catalogue of the Landesmuseum (Sammlung Online) as well as on the platform museum-digital. The corresponding collection objects can be found under the keyword "Landesgewerbemuseum Stuttgart".
